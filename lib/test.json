    "Course Description": [
      "In this course, critique is defined as a detailed, objective analysis of a work of graphic design and its effectiveness. Critique is an integral part of the making process for designers: it s not just how we determine if a work of design is or is not successful, it s how we move our work forward. Critique is also where other voices and opinions can be brought into the design process.   This course will introduce a lexicon (or vocabulary) in order for you to demonstrate clearer and more considered ways of talking about graphic design in the context of critique. Through this lexicon and a provided Critique Framework, we will model and then practice objectively describing how well a work of design functions based on specific, clearly articulated c riteria. By refining this skill, you will enhance your ability to communicate about design with peers, colleagues, and clients.   This course is essential to anyone looking to develop and refine a critical vocabulary around talking about art and design, such as:  - practicing graphic designers at all levels  - future and current students of art or design programs  - teachers teaching visual art, design, or related subjects  - any stakeholder in a design project that needs to communicate effectively with designers on their team.    This course is recommended to learners enrolled in either the Graphic Design Specialization or UI/UX Design Specialization on Coursera to further develop their skills in graphic design. You may take this course before, during, or after completing either Specializ ation.   Note this is not an art appreciation course for a general audience. While no prior experience is required to begin, the knowledge and skills taught in this course is useful only if you have some relationship to design in a professional context, i.e., practicing, studying, or teaching design, or working directly with designers.  No specific software or tools are required to complete this course."
